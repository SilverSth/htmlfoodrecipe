        Nepali momos are a type of steamed dumpling that are a popular street food and snack in Nepal. They are usually filled with minced meat, such as chicken or buffalo, or vegetables such as cabbage, carrot, and spinach. The filling is seasoned with spices such as cumin, coriander, and garlic, and often mixed with chopped onions or scallions.

The dumpling dough is typically made from flour and water and rolled out into circles. The filling is then placed in the center of the dough, and the edges are pinched together to seal the dumpling. The momos are then steamed in a momo steamer or a traditional bamboo basket called a thongba.

Nepali momos are typically served with a spicy tomato-based sauce or a spicy sesame and tomato sauce. They can be enjoyed as a snack or as a meal, and are often served with a side of achaar, a spicy pickle made from vegetables or fruits. Momos are a beloved Nepali food and are often enjoyed during festivals and special occasions.
